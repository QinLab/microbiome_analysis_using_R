# Microbiome Analysis Using R

Repository for a book on the analysis of 16S amplicon data using R. The book focuses heavily on the use of [PhyloSeq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) objects.

The content is designed to peice together disparate packets of knoweldge gathered through practice or found across forums or personal communications. The content is not meant to replace the numerous well-designed tutorials and vignettes from the official PhyloSeq documentation or found elsewhere on the web, but rather to synthesize and complement these resources.
