# Preface {-}

This book was designed to provide instruction and examples on how to process 16S amplicon data in R for microbial community ecology studies. The material was developed during over a period from Fall 2016 through Summer 2017 and represents a sythesis of material obtained during training at the [2017 Workshop on Genomics](http://evomics.org) and through forum posts across the internet. In particular, the [PhyloSeq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) and [dada2](https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2) GitHub issues page.
